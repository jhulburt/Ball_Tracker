## Project Objective
Follow an object and stay a preset distance behind it. Should be reasonably applicable to robots for testing at the end of the semester. 

## Contributions
The interesting thing about this roject is the challenge of making a robust object tracker and then applying it towards the goal of navigation.
There are exsisting Ball targeting object trackers that exsist out there but they are typically the intro example into object tracking code and work on a simply tracking an object of a single color across a screen. My task is a bit simpler because I know the size shape and color of my object of interest but compleating this project well will let me practice basic concepts of more complex machine learing and object tracking


## Project Plan
using navigation infomation from teleopbot and follow bot chapters of the book as well as the website https://www.pyimagesearch.com/
